<h2 id="why-track">Why You Need a Visa Tracker in 2025</h2>

<p>If you're reading this, you probably already know the stakes. Overstaying a visa can mean fines, entry bans, deportation, and a permanent mark on your travel record. The <a href="schengen-visa-90-180-rule-explained.html">Schengen 90/180 rule</a> alone trips up thousands of travelers each year because the rolling window calculation is more complex than it appears.</p>

<p>But visa tracking isn't just about avoiding overstays. It's about maximizing the time you have. Knowing exactly when your days "refresh" means you can plan longer trips, book flights with confidence, and stop making conservative estimates that leave days unused on the table.</p>

<p>With the EU's ETIAS system rolling out and countries tightening enforcement through digital border systems, the margin for error is shrinking. Manual tracking — checking passport stamps, counting on your fingers, maintaining a mental tally — worked when international travel was occasional. For nomads crossing borders monthly, it's a liability.</p>

<p>The right app replaces anxiety with certainty. You shouldn't be doing math at a border crossing. You should be checking a number on your phone.</p>

<p>We spent three months testing every visa tracking solution we could find — apps, web tools, spreadsheet templates, and hybrid approaches. Here's what we learned.</p>

<h2 id="criteria">How We Evaluated</h2>

<p>We judged each tool on six criteria that matter most to digital nomads:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Does the calculation match the official method? We verified results against the EU Commission's own calculator and manual calculations. Even a one-day error can have real consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Scope:</strong> Does it handle only Schengen, or also US visas, tax residency thresholds, and other country-specific rules? Most nomads need more than just a Schengen counter.</li>
<li><strong>Offline capability:</strong> Can you check your days without internet? At border crossings, airports, and remote locations, connectivity is never guaranteed.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Where does your travel data go? Your complete movement history is sensitive information. We examined data policies, storage locations, and whether data is shared with third parties.</li>
<li><strong>Usability:</strong> How fast is it to log a trip and check remaining days? If it takes more than 30 seconds, you won't use it consistently.</li>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> What does it cost, and is the pricing model sustainable? Subscriptions add up; one-time purchases give peace of mind.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nomad-visa-tracker">Nomad Visa Tracker — Editor's Choice</h2>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> $4.99 one-time<br>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> Web (PWA), iOS, Android<br>
<strong>Offline:</strong> Yes — full offline-first architecture<br>
<strong>Accuracy:</strong> ★★★★★</p>

<p>Full disclosure: this is our product. But we built it because nothing else on the market did what we needed. Here's what sets it apart, and we'll let you judge whether the comparison is fair by examining every competitor just as thoroughly.</p>

<p><strong>Schengen 90/180 with rolling window visualization.</strong> The core Schengen calculator uses the official rolling 180-day window method. But beyond just showing a number, it visualizes the window — you can see which days are about to "expire" and when they'll become available again. This forward-looking view is something no other app provides as clearly.</p>

<p><strong>US visa tracking with substantial presence test.</strong> For US visa holders, the app tracks not just simple day counts but the IRS substantial presence test, which uses a weighted formula across three years. This is particularly important for nomads who visit the US regularly on B1/B2 or ESTA and don't realize they're approaching <a href="digital-nomad-tax-residency-guide.html">tax residency thresholds</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tax residency warnings for 50+ countries.</strong> Set up the countries you frequent, and the app warns you as you approach their tax residency day-count thresholds. This is where visa tracking and tax planning intersect, and Nomad Visa Tracker handles both in one interface.</p>

<p><strong>Trip timeline and country stats.</strong> Every border crossing is logged in a visual timeline. Country stats show lifetime totals, longest streaks, and visit frequency. This isn't just useful — it's required data for many visa applications and tax filings.</p>

<p><strong>Truly offline-first.</strong> The app is built as a Progressive Web App with local-first data storage. Everything works without internet. Your data lives on your device, with optional encrypted sync if you want it across devices. At a land border crossing in rural Serbia with no signal, your visa data is still right there.</p>

<p><strong>One-time pricing.</strong> $4.99, once. No subscriptions, no premium tiers that gate essential features. Free updates forever. In a world of $9.99/month apps, this is refreshingly simple.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The app doesn't auto-detect border crossings (no GPS tracking — intentional for privacy). You need to log trips manually or import them. The interface is functional rather than flashy. If you want passport scanning or airline integration, look elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="sherpa">Sherpa</h2>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free (with premium tier)<br>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android<br>
<strong>Offline:</strong> Limited<br>
<strong>Accuracy:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>

<p>Sherpa positions itself as a travel restriction and visa requirement checker rather than a pure day tracker. It tells you what visa you need for a given destination, what COVID/health requirements exist (legacy feature), and entry conditions. It's backed by IATA data and used by some airlines.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excellent for checking entry requirements before booking. Good UI. Real-time updates on changing regulations. Backed by reliable data sources. Useful for the "can I enter this country?" question.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> It's primarily an entry requirement tool, not a day tracker. It doesn't maintain a running count of your Schengen days or warn you about approaching limits. You'd need to input each trip separately each time you want to check. No rolling window visualization. Limited offline functionality — it needs to fetch current regulations. Not designed for the "how many days do I have left?" use case that nomads face daily.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Occasional travelers who need to check visa requirements before trips. Not ideal for ongoing day-count tracking.</p>

<h2 id="travisa">TraVisa Counter</h2>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free / $3.99 premium<br>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS<br>
<strong>Offline:</strong> Yes<br>
<strong>Accuracy:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>

<p>TraVisa Counter is a focused Schengen calculator app for iOS. It does one thing — count Schengen days — and does it reasonably well. The interface is clean, data is stored locally, and the calculation is accurate for the basic Schengen use case.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Simple and fast to use. Accurate Schengen calculation. Local data storage. Clean iOS-native interface. Can export trip data. The premium version removes ads and adds widget support.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> iOS only — no Android or web version. Schengen only — no US visa tracking, no tax residency warnings, no multi-zone support. No trip timeline or country stats. No cloud sync between devices. The free version has intrusive ads. Hasn't been updated frequently — the UI feels dated compared to modern apps.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> iOS users who only need basic Schengen day counting and don't need multi-zone tracking.</p>

<h2 id="schengen-calc">Schengen Calculator Apps (Generic)</h2>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free to $2.99<br>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> Various<br>
<strong>Offline:</strong> Varies<br>
<strong>Accuracy:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>

<p>There are dozens of "Schengen Calculator" apps on both app stores. Most are simple date calculators: input your entry and exit dates, and they tell you days used and remaining. Quality varies enormously.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> We tested eight of these and found calculation errors in three of them. The most common bug: incorrectly implementing the rolling window by using fixed 180-day periods instead of the proper "look back from today" method. One app was off by up to 5 days in our test scenarios. When your freedom to travel depends on accuracy, "close enough" isn't good enough.</p>

<p><strong>Other issues:</strong> Most are hobby projects with infrequent updates. Several haven't been updated since 2022 and don't reflect Bulgaria and Romania joining Schengen in 2024. Many request unnecessary permissions (location, contacts). None offer US visa tracking or tax residency warnings. Few work offline. None provide the trip timeline or forward-looking analysis that serious nomads need.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> One-time quick checks if you trust the specific app's accuracy. Not for ongoing tracking.</p>

<h2 id="spreadsheets">DIY Spreadsheets</h2>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free<br>
<strong>Platforms:</strong> Any (Google Sheets, Excel)<br>
<strong>Offline:</strong> Depends<br>
<strong>Accuracy:</strong> ★★★★★ (if built correctly)</p>

<p>Many experienced nomads maintain their own visa tracking spreadsheets. Typically, these have columns for country, entry date, exit date, days, and a formula calculating the rolling 90/180 window. The best ones use helper rows that check every date in the 180-day lookback.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Completely customizable. No privacy concerns — your data is in your own spreadsheet. Can handle any visa rule if you build the formula. Free. You understand exactly how the calculation works because you built it.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Building an accurate rolling-window formula is non-trivial. Most homemade spreadsheets have subtle errors in edge cases (year boundaries, overlapping trips, same-day exits and entries). No mobile-friendly interface — checking your days means opening a spreadsheet. No push notifications or warnings. Easy to forget to update. Sharing across devices requires cloud storage. The effort to maintain increases with every trip.</p>

<p>We've seen spreadsheets from nomads who had been tracking for years — and found date entry errors that cascaded into incorrect calculations. The spreadsheet itself was right; the human data entry was wrong. Dedicated apps with input validation catch these errors.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Detail-oriented nomads who enjoy building tools and want maximum control. Not for anyone who might forget to update it.</p>

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>

<p>Your visa tracking data is essentially a complete record of your movements across international borders. It shows where you've been, when, and for how long. This is sensitive information that governments, employers, insurers, and data brokers could find valuable.</p>

<p>When evaluating any visa tracking tool, ask these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Where is data stored?</strong> On your device only? On the company's servers? In which jurisdiction? Local-only storage is the gold standard for privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Is data encrypted?</strong> Both at rest and in transit? End-to-end encrypted means even the service provider can't read it. Server-side encryption means they hold the keys.</li>
<li><strong>What's the data retention policy?</strong> Can you delete your data completely? Is it actually deleted from backups? GDPR gives European users the right to erasure, but enforcement varies.</li>
<li><strong>Is data shared with third parties?</strong> Some free apps monetize through data sharing. Your travel patterns are worth money to advertisers, airlines, and governments. Read the privacy policy — not the marketing summary, the actual policy.</li>
<li><strong>What happens if the company is acquired or shut down?</strong> Your data should be exportable. If the service disappears, your records shouldn't disappear with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nomad Visa Tracker stores all data locally on your device by default. Optional sync is end-to-end encrypted — we literally cannot read your travel data. We charge $4.99 because we sell software, not data. Free apps need a business model; if you're not paying for the product, you are the product.</p>

<p>Spreadsheets score well on privacy if stored locally, but Google Sheets means Google has your travel history. Something to consider.</p>

<h2 id="verdict">Our Verdict</h2>

<p>For digital nomads who cross borders regularly and need to track multiple visa zones and tax residency thresholds, <strong>Nomad Visa Tracker</strong> is the most complete solution available. It's the only tool that combines Schengen tracking, US visa monitoring, tax residency warnings, and trip analytics in one offline-first package — for a one-time price that's less than a coffee in Zurich.</p>

<p>If you only need Schengen tracking on iOS and don't mind ads, TraVisa Counter is a decent free option. If you need entry requirement information rather than day tracking, Sherpa serves a different purpose well. And if you're a spreadsheet enthusiast who enjoys building formulas, DIY tracking gives maximum control.</p>

<p>But for most nomads, the question isn't which tool is best — it's whether you're tracking at all. Any tracking is better than none. An entry ban from the Schengen zone lasts years. A <a href="digital-nomad-tax-residency-guide.html">surprise tax residency</a> can cost tens of thousands. Five dollars for peace of mind is the easiest investment in your nomad lifestyle you'll ever make.</p>

<p>Stop counting on your fingers. Start tracking with certainty.</p>
